All algorithms converged 100 times, using 100 different initial solutions,
for a constrained search space of $\left[-0.05, 0.05\right]$ . This search space is around
the optimal solution to avoid wrong convergence to a local minimum. In this search space,
Ackley Function has a well defined valley that has the solution as its center, as is shown in
Section~\ref{isolinesackley2D}.
