The best solutions of all algorithms for Beale Function, obtained using the minimal
distance of the solution, are shown in Table~\ref{solutions:beale}:

The Beale function has a very large search space around the optimal solution and
it had a reasonable number of iterations for each algorithm. The DFP method, superseeded by BFGS,
is surprisingly fast to find the solution. The LMA, known to be fast, had a reasonable performance.
BFGS/LBFGS performed as expected.

Although the column F. Value points to the the same value, this is a rounded value
and the real values are of order $10^{-22} \approx 10^{-14}$.
