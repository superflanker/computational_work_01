It is quite sure that all algorithms has good convergence for any algorithm for a
constrained search space of $\left[-0.15, 0.15\right]$. This search space is around
the optimal solution to avoid wrong convergence to a local minimum. In this search space,
Rastrigin Function has a well defined valley that has the solution as its center.
