All algorithms converged 100 times, using 100 different initial solutions,
for a constrained search space of $\left[0, 4\right]$ . This search space is around
the optimal solution to avoid wrong convergence to a local minimum. In this search space,
Booth Function has a well defined valley that has the solution as its center, as it is shown
in Section~\ref{isolinesbooth2D}.
